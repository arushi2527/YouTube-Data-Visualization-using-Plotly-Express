**YouTube Data Visualization with Plotly Express**

 Overview

This project explores data visualization using Python and Plotly Express. The goal is to transform raw data into insightful visual representations that are easy to interpret.

Using the “Most Subscribed YouTube Channels” dataset from Kaggle, I created:

- A Histogram to analyze subscriber counts

- A Pie Chart to compare video categories

- A Box Plot to examine the years when top creators started YouTube

This project demonstrates how a few lines of Python can uncover meaningful patterns in data.



**Tech Stack**

- Python 3.10+

- Google Colab

- Pandas – for data cleaning and manipulation

- Plotly Express – for interactive data visualizations



**Dataset**

- Name: Most Subscribed YouTube Channels

- Source: Kaggle Dataset

- File Used: most_subscribed_youtube_channels.csv

- Columns:

rank → Rank of the channel

youtuber → Channel name

subscribers → Total number of subscribers

video views → Total video views

video count → Number of videos uploaded

category → Genre/category of channel

started → Year channel was created



**Key Insights**

- Most top creators started their channels around 2013.

- Music and Entertainment dominate as leading YouTube categories.

- A significant cluster of channels has fewer than 40M subscribers, while a few (like T-Series) reach 200M+.
